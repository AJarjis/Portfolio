# Portfolio

My portfolio site were all my work can be seen along with blog posts and other stuff about me. 
Made using Jekyll and hosted on Netlify (would totally recommend this combo for a simple and cheap way to build a portfolio site). 
View my site [here](https://www.ajarjis.com "My Portfolio Site").
